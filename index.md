# About me

Welcome to my homepage! I am Baoqing Yue (Â≤≥ËëÜÈùí), a fourth-year undergraduate student at the Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University. I am currently under the supervision of Prof. Jingtao Zhan.

My research focuses on exploring the relationship between AI and Search technologies, specifically in the following areas:

- User simulation
- AI Interprebility
- Retrieval Augmented Generation
- AI for Legal Applications
